Before Alpha
------------
- Your top converting keyword include keyword without conversions

To fix
======
- need documentation about campaigns, inline help link to FAQ
- <idsubdatatable>1</idsubdatatable> shouldnt be in api response
- when used with visitsGenerator, in dowloads export XML, full_url and url is 0
- post 29 There seems not to be a way to export the pages information widget. 
  I wanted to download the entry pages to see where my visitors entered my site from,
  but there is no option to do so.
- ADD forward of non true show_values to forward when specified from URL to ajax
- disable show icon in some iframes and/or dashboard 
- clarify 'false' '0' values etc. //convert all JS datatable footer parameter values to '1' or '0'
- cron should return errors when token doesn't have any website

Bugs
====
- actions for year seems to not load (memory issue?)
- all graphic showing data evolution are labelled with the text &quot;nb_uniq_visitors&quot; 
  no matter if youre watching last visits graph, global visits graph or any other. 
  Its happening in every graph under Visitors subpages and in the Dashboard.
- In Referers-&gt;Evolution page, in addition, I think its melting titles because I read 
  in spanish &quot;Entrada directa nb_uniq_visitors&quot; for the first graph, 
  &quot;Paginas web nb_uniq_visitors&quot; for the second and so on.
- exclude all population doesn't work for actions

Reports improvements
====================
- add new column "overall visits with conversion"
- add visits with conversion sparkline in VisitsSummary overview
- add link under widgets to report (optional display)
- link under goal conversion to full goal reports (optional display)
- think of ways to show entry / exit pages and bounce rate.
- show unique visitors when available, otherwise show nb_visits by default
- bounce count should be bounce rate
- idem in 222 times that a returning visit has bounced (left the site after one page) 
- show new vs returning more clearly in UI
- see also #421
- add "days since last visit"
- add "visit count until conversion"
- add best search engines, keywords, campaigns, websites in referers overview

Test page
==========
- prepare a page with all use cases in iframes?
- test the actions datatable in this page?
- test datatable with search disabled
- test datatable with low population disabled
- without footer
- without all columns icon
