UI fixes + adjustements
====
- write test to make sure deployement don't include logger in file/db/etc
- write test to check disabled db plugin default
- search inside datatable doesnt really work eg. "web analytics" restore regex search
- bounce count should be bounce rate
- idem in 222 times that a returning visit has bounced (left the site after one page) 
- show new vs returning more clearly in UI
- calendar CSS on API page
- WRONG::: 147 sites Internet différents (utilisant 147 différentes adresses)
- see also #421

Following up show all columns new UI element
====
- disable show icon all columns for some reports, ie. Visits per visit duration, and downloads/outlinks
- disable show icon in some iframes and/or dashboard 
- exclude low population broken!
- default sorting order icon is not shown anymore
- labels for datatable actions are ugly

Fixing show all columns table view
====
- exclude low population should be displayed when viewing advanced table
- set custom truncation limit per datatable type (simple VS allColumns)
- bug display subtable icon is cut (see truncation limit)
- do proper CSS factoring
- when default is pie chart (visitors > settings), then shows advanced table icon
- i18n on title on datatable footer
- rename exportDataTable div in footerDataTableIcons or similar
- convert all JS datatable footer parameter values to '1' or '0'
- check state of javascript footer (should not have safe_decode and filter_add_columns blah)
- Blog post!

Bugs
- add icon calendar http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=calendar#Solution
- something is wrong in JS calendar when year selected
- I had to chmod 777 tmp/ to pass install
all graphic showing data evolution are labelled with the text &quot;nb_uniq_visitors&quot; no matter if youre watching last visits graph, global visits graph or any other. Its happening in every graph under Visitors subpages and in the Dashboard.
In Referers-&gt;Evolution page, in addition, I think its melting titles because I read in spanish &quot;Entrada directa nb_uniq_visitors&quot; for the first graph, &quot;Paginas web nb_uniq_visitors&quot; for the second and so on.

To clean
- plugins should listen to user delete/ site delete and delete their own user/site related data
- why widgetize inherits Piwik_Widgetize_Controller
- PLUGINS HAVE THEIR OWN TESTS

Documentation
- postEvent smarty doc is not clear, + feature we're not using (filter but what we need is simply way to print out html in templates from plugins)

Live! plugin
- api propre
- html
- jquery spy
- simple stats above in TEXT
- Security review
- blog post, push version
