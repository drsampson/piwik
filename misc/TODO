To fix
======

On 2009-02-16, I got ~100 Visitors (usually 20-30) on a site in Piwik but that size for that amount of user seems too much for me.

purge on demand
- add zlib requirement for gzcompress
- add upgradephp ctype
- Lors de la génération des données sur mon site de test :
Fatal error: Call to undefined method Piwik_Tracker_Db::prefixTable() in E:\Projects\wowww\piwik\core\Tracker\Db.php on line 241
- keywords duplicated
- On the dashboard, the pie graph for the browsers by family widget is very small.
- Problème de traduction dans Visiteurs > Récapitulatifs
Évolution sur les 30 derniers __ days __
- trim keywords
- cron should return errors when token doesn't have any website
- need documentation about campaigns, inline help link to FAQ
- <idsubdatatable>1</idsubdatatable> shouldnt be in api response
- when used with visitsGenerator, in dowloads export XML, full_url and url is 0
- ADD forward of non true show_values to forward when specified from URL to ajax
- disable show icon in some iframes and/or dashboard 
- clarify 'false' '0' values etc. //convert all JS datatable footer parameter values to '1' or '0'
- why widgetize inherits Piwik_Widgetize_Controller
- plugins should listen to user delete/ site delete and delete their own user/site related data
- postEvent smarty doc is not clear, + feature we're not using (filter but what we need is simply way to print out html in templates from plugins)

- actions for year seems to not load (memory issue?)
