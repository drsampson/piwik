Bugs
- add icon calendar http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=calendar#Solution
- something is wrong in JS calendar when year selected
- I had to chmod 777 tmp/ to pass install
all graphic showing data evolution are labelled with the text &quot;nb_uniq_visitors&quot; no matter if youre watching last visits graph, global visits graph or any other. Its happening in every graph under Visitors subpages and in the Dashboard.
In Referers-&gt;Evolution page, in addition, I think its melting titles because I read in spanish &quot;Entrada directa nb_uniq_visitors&quot; for the first graph, &quot;Paginas web nb_uniq_visitors&quot; for the second and so on.

To clean
- plugins should listen to user delete/ site delete and delete their own user/site related data
- why widgetize inherits Piwik_Widgetize_Controller
- PLUGINS HAVE THEIR OWN TESTS

Documentation
- postEvent smarty doc is not clear, + feature we're not using (filter but what we need is simply way to print out html in templates from plugins)

Live! plugin
- api propre
- html
- jquery spy
- simple stats above in TEXT
