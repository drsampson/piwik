all graphic showing data evolution are labelled with the text &quot;nb_uniq_visitors&quot; no matter if youre watching last visits graph, global visits graph or any other. Its happening in every graph under Visitors subpages and in the Dashboard.
In Referers-&gt;Evolution page, in addition, I think its melting titles because I read in spanish &quot;Entrada directa nb_uniq_visitors&quot; for the first graph, &quot;Paginas web nb_uniq_visitors&quot; for the second and so on.


To clean
- plugins should listen to user delete/ site delete and delete their own user/site related data
- in API request, menu/widget hooks should not be triggered
- embed widgets codes above widget?
- why widgetize inherits Piwik_Widgetize_Controller
- rss cache + user agent piwik
- PLUGINS HAVE THEIR OWN TESTS

Documentation
- postEvent smarty doc is not clear, + feature we're not using (filter but what we need is simply way to print out html in templates from plugins)

Live! plugin
- api propre
- html
- jquery spy
