test widgetize on piwik.org 
test installation + dashboard + add widget
check commit doesnt have any new renderView() call

test set wrong permission and trigger frontController:checkDir

why widgetize inherits Piwik_Widgetize_Controller
we should call login->logout in installation->welcome instead of duplicating code
change the loading widget red button with the standard blue loading
widgetize should export the same format as currently seen: the callback to generate the embed code should be called when user clicks on icon below graph
widgetize should work with clearspring: create a new iframe with an iframe + clearspring button
language selection
separate all Core doc to Plugins and Users doc
create ticket for wrong display seconds
rss cache + user agent piwik

to check
========
check that when online archiving disabled, take the last valid archiving
ACTIONS limit seem not right, seem limited to 50 instead of 200 for root
editing site web with single quote bugs in siteAdmin???
something is wrong in JS calendar when year selected

design notes
============
API request shouldnt be SO DataTable aware
merge config file instead of annoying file selection?
