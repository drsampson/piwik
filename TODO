# Core
  - Translations framework ready (all strings translatable) + translated in french and english
    To translate: all strings in templates, all strings in JS variables, design a generic system for the php exceptions to handle multilingual error messages
  
# Plugins
  - Clickheat heatmap 
  - Select a logo to be displayed when calling the piwik.php 
  	currently a 1*1 transparent Gif is displayed but we could have some nice logos
  - Import phpmyvisites v2.x statistics into piwik easily (we have to reach the 15,000 users of phpmyvisites)
  - Goals setup and tracking. We define a goal by a URL to reach (or a part of a url), goal conversion check, goal information (referers, countries, keywords, etc.)
  - PDF export
  - Email sending containing statistics inline or attached file
