PLUGINS HAVE THEIR OWN TESTS

Bugs
- google chrome/safari bug with calendar + language dropdown
- api for setLanguage/getLanguage
- site selector is hidden first, then shown
- WRONG::: 147 sites Internet différents (utilisant 147 différentes adresses)
- Undefined text for "loading data..." on piwik.org demo!
- we should call login->logout in installation->welcome instead of duplicating code
- fix images in sub tables when JS loaded
- create ticket for wrong display seconds

To clean
- rename LogStats in Tracker
- The UI could be "security trimmed". So a normal user (a customer in this case) should not see the "admin", "API" links ...
- If the user is only allowed to see one website to analyze the dropdown-control for other sites could be hidden.
- numbers below datatable should be darker grey
- test set wrong permission and trigger frontController:checkDir
- fdd2div clean in /libs
- plugins should listen to user delete/ site delete and delete their own user/site related data
- in API request, menu/widget hooks should not be triggered
- embed widgets codes above widget?
- why widgetize inherits Piwik_Widgetize_Controller
- rss cache + user agent piwik

Features
- thank you page for translators loaded on wiki
- widgetize should export the same format as currently seen: the callback to generate the embed code should be called when user clicks on icon below graph
- widgetize should work with clearspring: create a new iframe with an iframe + clearspring button

Update system. when updating from previous to first version with update system we need to:
- create indices now created at install
- purge old archive tables containing temporary archive data
- remove cookie detection as it is completely wrong
- remove color_depth field

Documentation
- separate all Core doc to Plugins and Users doc
- postEvent smarty doc is not clear, + feature we're not using (filter but what we need is simply way to print out html in templates from plugins)

Live! plugin
- api propre
- html
- jquery spy
- simple stats above in TEXT
- Security review
- blog post, push version

to check
========
check that when online archiving disabled, take the last valid archiving
ACTIONS limit seem not right, seem limited to 50 instead of 200 for root
editing site web with single quote bugs in siteAdmin???
something is wrong in JS calendar when year selected

design notes
============
API request shouldnt be SO DataTable aware
merge config file instead of annoying file selection?

CHANGES DONE TO LIBRARIES
=========================
- edited Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php added resetConfigArray()
- edited zend_log and changed attr to protected
- fixed bug fwrite in zend_log stream writer
- fixed PEAR so that it works under PHP5 with STRICT MODE enabled
