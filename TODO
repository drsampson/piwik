MAILING LIST SESSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PLUGINS HAVE THEIR OWN TESTS

embed widgets codes above widget?
test set wrong permission and trigger frontController:checkDir

why widgetize inherits Piwik_Widgetize_Controller
we should call login->logout in installation->welcome instead of duplicating code
fix images in sub tables
change the loading widget red button with the standard blue loading
widgetize should export the same format as currently seen: the callback to generate the embed code should be called when user clicks on icon below graph
widgetize should work with clearspring: create a new iframe with an iframe + clearspring button
separate all Core doc to Plugins and Users doc
create ticket for wrong display seconds
rss cache + user agent piwik
rename LogStats in Tracker
remove all instances of insert() and delete() and update()
numbers below datatable should be darker grey

test_whenWhiteListedTable_butNoIdsite_throwsException()
{}


postEvent smarty doc is not clear, + feature we're not using (filter but what we need is simply way to print out html in templates from plugins)

1. The UI could be "security trimmed". So a normal user (a customer
   in this case) should not see the "admin", "API" links ...
2. If the user is only allowed to see one website to analyze the
   dropdown-control for other sites could be hidden.
   
to check
========
check that when online archiving disabled, take the last valid archiving
ACTIONS limit seem not right, seem limited to 50 instead of 200 for root
editing site web with single quote bugs in siteAdmin???
something is wrong in JS calendar when year selected

design notes
============
API request shouldnt be SO DataTable aware
merge config file instead of annoying file selection?
