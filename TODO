- api for setLanguage/getLanguage
- site selector is hidden first, then shown
- WRONG::: 147 sites Internet différents (utilisant 147 différentes adresses)
- Undefined text for "loading data..." on piwik.org demo!
- we should call login->logout in installation->welcome instead of duplicating code
- fix images in sub tables when JS loaded
- wrong display seconds 42 min 2563 s total time spent by the visitors
- check that when online archiving disabled, take the last valid archiving
- ACTIONS limit seem not right, seem limited to 50 instead of 200 for root
- editing site web with single quote bugs in siteAdmin???
- something is wrong in JS calendar when year selected
- API request shouldnt be SO DataTable aware (fixed with ResponseBuilder??)

To clean
- rename LogStats in Tracker
- widgetMenu but object called AddMenu 
- some JS start with capital letter, others with normal letters
- The UI could be "security trimmed". So a normal user (a customer in this case) should not see the "admin", "API" links ...
- If the user is only allowed to see one website to analyze the dropdown-control for other sites could be hidden.
- numbers below datatable should be darker grey
- test set wrong permission and trigger frontController:checkDir
- fdd2div clean in /libs
- plugins should listen to user delete/ site delete and delete their own user/site related data
- in API request, menu/widget hooks should not be triggered
- embed widgets codes above widget?
- why widgetize inherits Piwik_Widgetize_Controller
- rss cache + user agent piwik

Documentation
- postEvent smarty doc is not clear, + feature we're not using (filter but what we need is simply way to print out html in templates from plugins)

Live! plugin

- html
- jquery spy
- simple stats above in TEXT
- Security review
