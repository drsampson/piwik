TODO FIRST
==========
Finish the Openads plugin: 
	- using the ../../openads_piwik_bridge class, 
	- do the prototype to make sure we can print the piwik image with DOM from the header
	- update the openads_piwik_bridge class comment and the specification
	- send mail to the team to show the demo
Classify all the below in TRAC and prioritize


SMALL FEATURES
==============
- when a method is called and doesn't make any access check, 
  we can throw a NoticeException and display the message 
  in debug mode in the API returned value in the field "notice" or "debug"
- in the piwik.php process, we could do without all the information in the cookie except for the idvisitor
  we could select the information last_action_time, last_id_action, etc. assuming we have the idvisitor in the cookie
  this would allow to save the logs later by big bulk
- Provide Config file feature for plugins (works as the translation system)
- CHANGE setColumnsToDisplay TO setColumnsIdsToDisplay
- in the config.ini.php, it is not possible to set a configuration settings without setting the whole category
  we should have some sort of merging that would make possible to set only a sub configuration variable from the global.ini.php into the config.ini.php
  this way, during an upgrade, we could keep only the config/config.ini.php and overwrite the other config files with the update piwik version
  and we would keep the changes made to some configuration variables
- piwik could try create the database if it doesn't exist

BUGS
====
- set the root password encrypted in the configuration file
- The numbers in Visits summary seem wrong when compared to phpmyvisites, but the nb of actiosn under the action table for example is correct
  http://ns21996.ovh.net/piwik/?module=Home&action=index&idSite=1&period=day&date=yesterday
- Purge log_ when archiving is done
- archiving is creating some wrong lines in the archive_numeric tables for future dates
- hide the generator + phpdocumentor script from being triggered by the release
- monthly unique visitors count is WRONG
- create the tmp directory + subdir automatically
- the referer URLs with host registered as main_url or alias_url should NOT be counted as referer
- the token md5 generation doesn't check that the md5 generated is unique, 
  but it should (the field is unique in the database)
- if elements from the config file are deleted, bug without any notice or warning
  system for config file default values?
- if the path necessary sometimes in the configuration do not have a / when they should
  it could break the system...
	/*
	 * Make sure the compare directory has a trailing slash so that /tmp doesn't
	 * accidentally match /tmpfoo
	 */
	if ($element{strlen($element)-1} != $slash) {
	$element .= $slash;
	}
- is_numeric is not valid. Replace by is_int OR is_float
- images.google.X is not counted as a search engine. needs to read the prev variable and then the q variable.

User Interface bugs
===================
- searching on countries should search on the final label and not the iso code
- define the default output type on a per table basis
- design a generic system to add _blocks_ in _pages_ (different from the _views_ associated to the controllers)
- plugins can add & modify the menu
- add a column percent in all the tables, or add a new column aggregating "NB (percent%)"
- when a given output is chosen (Tag cloud) hide the icon under the datatable

Browsers specific bugs
======================
Opera 9.23 windows
	- actions expanding / collapse doesnt work. always expand. multiple clicks load the content multiple times
	- the columns width are changing when sorting the columns, annoying effect

TODO MISC
=========
- check that ajax called made once per request
- when the plugins are not used in the piwik.php logging script, don't load the related files
- Archive::build() must have the same parameters order as all the API calls that use idSite, Period, Date
- change all .png images to GIF
- Ensure that all parameters to the API are checked against security rules etc.
- check that the yesterday/today etc. feature doesnt cause any bug in the process 
  (like when checking if 2007-09-02 which is yesterday has been archived when piwik thinks 'yesterday' has been archived...)

CHANGES DONE TO LIBRARIES
=========================
- edited zend_log and changed attr to protected
- fixed bug fwrite in zend_log stream writer
- fixed PEAR so that it works under PHP5 with STRICT MODE enabled

COMMENT
=======
When commenting
- check warning PHP DOC for missing @package
- look for "[TAB]function " for missing public/private on methods


WEBSITE
=======
- launch blog

           ------------------
				Timeline
           ------------------
To add in some release
- Update piwik
- PLugin update
- API update / backward compatibility
- Plugins management interface

Todo before alpha public release
================================
# Core
   - Installation process so that installing Piwik only requires to upload the directory
   - Interface architecture: widgets style page building, menu editing by plugins
   - Fixed all known critical/important bugs
   - Testing piwik on a > 10,000 visits per day website. Check the memory required by the archiving
   
# Plugins
   - Openads integration working

# Misc
   - Launch a blog for the Piwik development and public announce
   - Clean all the google docs piwik related and save them in the TRAC wiki + task tracker

Deadline: 5 november 2007

Todo before beta public release
===============================
# Core
  - easy way to access historical data (eg. the last 30 days)
  - building RSS feeds of every information
  - Limit number of rows saved in the datatable during the archiving process
  - Testing the piwik on some huge websites (> 50,000 visits per day) and make sure it works: Db optimization, php memory profiling
  - Theming system so that we can create different look n feel for the piwik interface

# Plugins
  - Automatic Outlink tracking + download tracking plugin
  - Automatically delete/keep onlyq  some parameters from the URLs before processing it during the visitor logging process
    for example the url example.com/page/index.php?userid=8571498752487&module=homepage could be example.com/page/index.php?module=homepage after removing the userid parameter
  - Exclude the webmaster based on a cookie. The cookie is then checked in piwik.php and the visitor is not counted in the stats
  - Exclude the webmaster based on IP / IP range. The ip is then checked in piwik.php and the visitor is not counted in the stats
  - Precise geolocalisation using Maxmind database (.dat file OR apache module OR php module)
  - Last N visitors information 

# Documentation
  - All core classes phpdoc documented + documentation reviewed by 1 other developer
  - Write simple plugins that would be useful and at the same time would help as "How to write Piwik Plugins" tutorials
  - Document the database design and the concepts
  - Document the Piwik architecture: API concept, Plugins concept, Logging engine, Archiving process, Reporting process, MVC model, DataTable concept

Deadline: 20 december 2007

Todo before stable release
==========================
# Core
  - Translations framework ready (all strings translatable) + translated in french and english
    To translate: all strings in templates, all strings in JS variables, design a generic system for the php exceptions to handle multilingual error messages
  - Update process that makes it easy to update piwik
  - versioning in APIs to make sure we don't break the plugins/widgets when updating the APIs
  - complete profiling of the source and fix the easy to fix problems
  
# Plugins
  - Select a logo to be displayed when calling the piwik.php 
  	currently a 1*1 transparent Gif is displayed but we could have some nice logos
  - Import phpmyvisites v2.x statistics into piwik easily (we have to reach the 15,000 users of phpmyvisites)
  - Goals setup and tracking. We define a goal by a URL to reach (or a part of a url), goal conversion check, goal information (referers, countries, keywords, etc.)
  - PDF export
  - Email sending containing statistics inline or attached file

# Documentation
  - End user documentation that covers the main point. Not complete but it would make it easy to get started with Piwik for a non technical user.
 

Deadline = Q1 2008
