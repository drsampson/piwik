Deployment

* piwik.js is minified using YUICompressor 2.4.2.

  To compress the code containing the evil "eval", either apply the patch from
  http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yuicompressor/ticket/2343811,
  or run:

	sed 's/eval/replacedEvilString/' <piwik.js | \
	java -jar yuicompressor-2.4.2.jar --type js --line-break 1000 | \
	sed 's/replacedEvilString/eval/' >piwik-min.js

* The uncompressed piwik.js resides in the js/ folder. If you omit the filename,
  js/index.php will serve the minified version.  A side effect of this feature
  is that it is not currently blockable by various AdBlock filters.

	<script src="http"//yoursite/js/" type="text/javascript">

* In a production environment, the tests/javascript folder is not used and can
  be removed (if present).

  Note: if the file "js/tests/enable_sqlite" exists, additional unit tests
        (requires the sqlite extension) are enabled.
